The file "OutlookAddIn/JSON/EmailData.json" is a JSON file. It doesn't contain executable code, but rather structured data. Here is an example of how the initial empty JSON file might look:

```json
{
  "emailData": []
}
```

This JSON file starts with an empty array under the key "emailData". As the user interacts with the add-in, new entries will be appended to this array. Each entry will be an object containing the email metadata and user input, structured according to the `EmailDataSchema` and `UserInputSchema`.
